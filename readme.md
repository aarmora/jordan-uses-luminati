# Jordan Uses Luminati

This package has some sample code using [Luminati.io](https://luminati.io/?affiliate=ref_5f240848c7669177abf8ef2a). Positionstack is an API that is extremely easy to use for any kind of location or geocoding.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

You'll need to get credentials from [Luminati.io](https://luminati.io/?affiliate=ref_5f240848c7669177abf8ef2a) and rename `.sample.env` file to `.env` and place your credentials there.

When you want to use the proxy, leave `prod=true` in the .env file. When you do not, just remove `prod=true`.

There are commented out portions of the code that test with axios, request-promise, and Puppeteer. Just comment the portions you wish to use in before running.

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
